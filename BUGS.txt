1) Didn't check if a grid already had a bomb when assigning them, so there could be fewer bombs than there is suppose to be (sets bomb on same unit twice)
2) If level assignment has more bombs than squares, it gets caught in infinite loop
3) MULTIPLE  - structure the level properties file wrong
4) If either gridHeight or gridWidth are 0, the game wouldn't work (throws error)
5) If gridNumSides is not 3, 4, or 6 throw an error
6) All error handling (throws/try-catches) could be bugged
7) Didnt add properties files to build path
8) PopulateMines --> after check if firstClick, no i-- before continue
9) Click and drag mouse from one grid unit to another, original grid unit stays pressed
10) If reset game, timer doesn't start over. 
11) Not showing some powerup/help buttons when game is a certain size.
12) Various with saving/retrieving loading score, depending upon if you use Exit command or other.
13) When timer runs out, having it say Congrats, you won -150 points!
14) If you have exactly the amount of points for a powerup, it won't work.
15) hit Level Select when already at Level Select
