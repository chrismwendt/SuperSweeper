1) Didn't check if a grid already had a bomb when assigning them, so there could be fewer bombs than there is suppose to be (sets bomb on same unit twice)
2) If level assignment has more bombs than squares, it gets caught in infinite loop
3) MULTIPLE  - structure the level properties file wrong
4) If either gridHeight or gridWidth are 0, the game wouldn't work (throws error)
5) If gridNumSides is not 3, 4, or 6 throw an error
6) All error handling (throws/try-catches) could be bugged
7) Didnt add properties files to build path
8) PopulateMines --> after check if firstClick, no i-- before continue
9) Click and drag mouse from one grid unit to another, original grid unit stays pressed
